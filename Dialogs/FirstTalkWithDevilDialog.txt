Introduction:

Line_1_Devil
\"Oh! - Hello! - I was waiting for you... But why did you take so long?...\" he greeted with excitement and asked, intrigued.

Line_2_PLayer
\"Where in the hell... am I?..\" he said, pissed and confused but slowly.

Line_3_Devil
You are... dead, Pretty dead! Things here may be a bit different from what you are used to... 

Line_4_PLayer
\"A bit!? you are a glowing orb...\" he said, confused.

Line_5_Devil
Hahahaha... indeed, indeed! But fear not, there are way worse places where the living can go when they are, well... no longer living. Compared to other possible places, this is a paradise, a heaven!

Line_6_PLayer
\"A heaven? So why am I alone? You know what? In my life, I've already met many people like you...\", he said, suspicious

Line_7_Devil
Charming?...

Line_8_Player
Full of shit...

Line_9_Devil
Well, well, you got me! You are not there... yet! But please, consider following the Eden's Path. Once you finish it, you will see what eternity looks like, I promise. I may be biased because I created it all, but... I LOVE IT!

Line_10_Player
I guess we have a deal then. I don't see many other options.

Line_11_Devil
Splendid! What a remarkable specimen you are! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have my own duties to attend to. You know, as a deity, and blah blah blah. But rest assured, we shall see each other soon.

Line_12_Player
WAIT! HOW AM I!... supposed to get to the end?
